Introduction
Welcome to my Web Dev portfolio, a full-stack Single Page Application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and deployed on Google Firebase. This application demonstrates modern web development practices and offers a seamless user experience.

Project Structure
The frontend is built using React, creating a dynamic and responsive user interface.
The backend code features Express.js and Node.js, providing a robust server-side platform.
Note: Due to incompatibility issues with Firebase, the MongoDB database is not directly integrated into the deployed frontend. However, the backend code, including database interactions, is fully functional and can be reviewed in the backend folder.
Deployment
This application is deployed using Google Firebase.

Local Setup
To set up the project locally:

Clone the Repository:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Frontend Setup:
Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies.
Backend Setup:
Navigate to the backend directory.

Although the database is not connected in the deployed version, you can set up a local MongoDB instance to test the backend functionality.
